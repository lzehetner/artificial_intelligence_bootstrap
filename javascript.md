## Overview

Our team is building a Fact Generator, which will be a web application that generates interesting and educational facts at the click of a button. The Fact Generator will contain a library of pre-made facts in a file, which can be displayed to the user. In addition, the user can add their own custom facts to the library, which must be at least 30 characters long, and will be stored in an external file.
